	abstract = {Microplastics are present in aquatic ecosystems the world over and may influence the feeding, growth, reproduction, and survival of freshwater and marine biota; however, the extent and magnitude of potential effects of microplastics on aquatic organisms is poorly understood. In the current study, we conducted a meta-analysis of published literature to examine impacts of exposure to microplastics on consumption (and feeding), growth, reproduction, and survival of fish and aquatic invertebrates. While we did observe within-taxa negative effects for all four categories of responses, many of the effects summarized in our study were neutral, indicating that the effects of exposure to microplastics are highly variable across taxa. The most consistent effect was a reduction in consumption of natural prey when microplastics were present. For some taxa, negative effects on growth, reproduction and even survival were also evident. Organisms that serve as prey to larger predators, e.g., zooplankton, may be particularly susceptible to negative impacts of exposure to microplastic pollution, with potential for ramifications throughout the food web. Future work should focus on whether microplastics may be affecting aquatic organisms more subtly, e.g., by influencing exposure to contaminants and pathogens, or by acting at a molecular level.},

	abstract = {The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America provide valuable ecosystem services, including fisheries, to the surrounding population. Given the prevalence of other anthropogenic stressors that have historically affected the fisheries of the Great Lakes (e.g., eutrophication, invasive species, overfishing), climate change is often viewed as a long-term stressor and, subsequently, may not always be prioritized by managers and researchers. However, climate change has the potential to negatively affect fish and fisheries in the Great Lakes through its influence on habitat. In this paper, we (1) summarize projected changes in climate and fish habitat in the Great Lakes; (2) summarize fish responses to climate change in the Great Lakes; (3) describe key interactions between climate change and other stressors relevant to Great Lakes fish, and (4) summarize how climate change can be incorporated into fisheries management. In general, fish habitat is projected to be characterized by warmer temperatures throughout the water column, less ice cover, longer periods of stratification, and more frequent and widespread periods of bottom hypoxia in productive areas of the Great Lakes. Based solely on thermal habitat, fish populations theoretically could experience prolonged optimal growth environment within a changing climate, however, models that assess physical habitat influences at specific life stages convey a more complex picture. Looking at specific interactions with other stressors, climate change may exacerbate the negative impacts of both eutrophication and invasive species for fish habitat in the Great Lakes. Although expanding monitoring and research to consider climate change interactions with currently studied stressors, may offer managers the best opportunity to keep the valuable Great Lakes fisheries sustainable, this expansion is globally applicable for large lake ecosystem dealing with multiple stressors in the face of continued human-driven changes.},

	abstract = {Successful invasive species must pass through several invasion stages, and life history or trophic strategies allowing for successful transitions may change as the species advances from one stage to the next. To evaluate the role of life history shifts in the invasion success of white perch (Morone americana), age and length at maturity, gonadosomatic index, and growth were compared across three invasive reservoir populations ranging from 1, 11, and 21 years since initial detection. Individuals in the newly introduced population exhibited increased growth and had higher mean reproductive investment than the two established populations across both study years. Individuals in the newest population also matured earlier than those in the older populations in 2009, but maturity schedules did not differ in 2010, possibly due to changes in environmental conditions causing life history shifts in both older populations. Overall, it appears that life history plasticity confers an important advantage to invasive species, allowing them to adapt for successful transitions throughout the invasion process, as well as to local conditions within the invaded system once they become fully integrated into established communities.},

Through a comprehensive literature review, we discuss how individual- and population-level vital rates, including growth, foraging, reproduction, recruitment, and mortality, are mediated by biotic (e.g., density dependence, resource availability) and abiotic (e.g., temperature, light) environmental variables. As fisheries exploitation is a major source of size-selective mortality in many percid populations, we also examine the potential impacts of fishing mortality on both population metrics and individual vital rates, and identify several research areas that require further investigation. Through this review we aim to identify the major environmental drivers of variation in percid vital rates and thereby inform management practices for both wild and cultured percid populations.},

	abstract = {Fisheries are selective, capturing fish based on their body size, behaviour, life stage, or location. Over time, if harvest pressure is strong enough and variation in traits heritable, evolution can occur that affects key aspects of the ecology of fish stocks. Most compelling examples of rapid evolution in response to harvest have come from marine systems. Here, we review the state of knowledge on fisheries-induced evolution (FIE) in the Laurentian Great Lakes where subsistence, commercial, and recreational fisheries have operated for centuries. We conclude that stocks experienced harvest rates high enough and for long enough to undergo evolution. While historical fisheries exploited more juveniles, some contemporary Great Lakes fisheries target primarily adult size-classes thus reducing current selection for earlier maturation; however, other traits and behaviours could evolve (e.g., growth, timing of spawning, boldness). While commercial harvest previously dominated, recreational fishing is now expected to be a strong contributor to harvest selection in the Great Lakes. Environmental variation, density-dependence, invasive species, and the genetic legacy of population bottlenecks and stocking interact with, and make it more challenging to detect, FIE in the Great Lakes than in marine systems. Case studies are presented for Great Lakes stocks of yellow perch Perca flavescens and lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis for which FIE has been investigated. The evidence for FIE in the Great Lakes is currently sparse, potentially because of the low research focus on this topic or because of the interacting influence of environmental variation and anthropogenic stressors.},

	abstract = {Offspring size determines offspring survival rates; thus, understanding factors influencing offspring size variability could elucidate variation in population dynamics. Offspring size variation is influenced through multigenerational adaptation to local environments and within-lifetime plastic responses to environmental variability and maternal effects among individuals. Moreover, offspring size variation may represent trade-offs in energy allocation within individuals that influence lifetime reproductive success. However, the mechanisms whereby environmental conditions influence offspring size, e.g., via inducing adaptive and plastic variation in population-scale maternal effects, remain poorly understood. We evaluated intra-specific variation in maternal effects, egg size, and intra-individual egg size variation in six populations of walleye (Sander vitreus) and related among- and within-population patterns to thermal conditions. Egg size was conserved within populations and negatively related to long-term thermal conditions among populations, while maternal effect strengths were positively related to thermal conditions, suggesting that populations inhabiting warmer environments adapted to produce smaller eggs but stronger maternal effects. Within a population, egg size was positively related to colder winters, suggesting cold winters may alter egg size through effects on maternal condition or as an adaptive maternal effect to improve offspring survival. Intra-individual egg size variation varied little among populations or with female size, but declined with increasing summer and decreasing winter temperatures. Our result suggests that environmental conditions could impact not only short-term offspring production but also spur adaptive changes in offspring phenotypes. Thus, it is necessary to account for adaptive responses to predict population dynamics under environmental changes.},

	abstract = {Size-selective harvest of fish stocks can lead to maturation at smaller sizes and younger ages, which may depress stock productivity and recovery. Such changes in maturation may be very slow to reverse, even following complete fisheries closures. We evaluated temporal trends in maturation of five Great Lakes stocks of yellow perch (Perca flavescens Mitchill) using indices that attempt to disentangle plastic and evolutionary changes in maturation: age at 50\% maturity and probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs). Four populations were fished commercially throughout the time series, while the Lake Michigan fishery was closed following a stock collapse. We documented rapid increases in PMRNs of the Lake Michigan stock coincident with the commercial fishery closure. Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron PMRNs also increased following reduced harvest, while Lake Erie populations were continuously fished and showed little change. The rapid response of maturation may have been enhanced by the short generation time of yellow perch and potential gene flow between northern and southern Lake Michigan, in addition to potential reverse adaptation following the fishing moratorium. These results suggest that some fish stocks may retain the ability to recover from fisheries-induced life history shifts following fishing moratoria.},

	abstract = {Maternal effects have been observed to interact with genotypic and environmental influences to structure offspring phenotypes across a wide variety of taxa. In fishes, maternal effects may be especially important due to their potential influence on development and survival during early ontogeny – a period with high potential for population regulation. While previous studies have confirmed that maternal effects on offspring phenotype are common in fishes, the consistency with which they positively affect offspring fitness throughout early ontogeny remains largely unknown. We examined maternal effects on offspring fitness by quantifying relationships between maternal (length, mass and age), egg (diameter, mass and density) and larval traits (length, yolk-sac volume and survival) in yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Consistent with several past studies, positive relationships among maternal and egg traits were evident. While egg mass was positively related to larval size at hatching, direct relationships between maternal and larval metrics were not apparent. Larval survival appeared to have two critical periods; in contrast with expectations, survival in the first 5 days posthatch was strongly negatively related to female size and age, while survival over the following 9 days was unrelated to maternal traits. Throughout the study, survival was positively related to yolk-sac volume. Our unexpected observation of a negative relationship between maternal size and age and initial larval survival indicates that maternal effects may not be consistent throughout larval ontogeny. In fact, maternal effects appear to be dynamic influences on offspring fitness, and may have complex effects on individual- and population-level reproductive success.},

Females held at 4° C also exhibited less within-clutch egg size variation than females held at 13° C. Moreover, eggs differed among temperature treatments in the overall proportions of 18 fatty acids, with the colder treatments resulting in potentially higher quality eggs containing more of the unsaturated fatty acids C16:1, C22:6-n3 and C18:2 cis. Female somatic condition also varied with temperature. Maternal somatic growth and protein content increased while lipid content decreased in 13° C compared to the colder treatments. There were, however, no differences among treatments in the fatty acid composition of maternal muscle. These results suggest that the temperatures experienced during winter may be less influential to P. flavescens egg size or number, which may exhibit relatively little plasticity in this species, but can alter both the number of females that spawn and the overall composition of eggs and maternal somatic tissues, which may have implications for future reproductive success.},

	abstract = {Fish stock-recruitment dynamics may be difficult to elucidate because of nonstationary relationships resulting from shifting environmental conditions and fluctuations in important vital rates such as individual growth or maturation. The Great Lakes have experienced environmental stressors that may have changed population demographics and stock-recruitment relationships while causing the declines of several prey fish species, including rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). We investigated changes in the size and maturation of rainbow smelt in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron and recruitment dynamics of the Lake Michigan stock over the past four decades. Mean lengths and length-at-maturation of rainbow smelt generally declined over time in both lakes. To evaluate recruitment, we used both a Ricker model and a Kalman filter-random walk (KF-RW) model which incorporated nonstationarity in stock productivity by allowing the productivity term to vary over time. The KF-RW model explained nearly four times more variation in recruitment than the Ricker model, indicating the productivity of the Lake Michigan stock has increased. By accounting for this nonstationarity, we were able identify significant variations in stock productivity, evaluate its importance to rainbow smelt recruitment, and speculate on potential environmental causes for the shift. Our results suggest that investigating mechanisms driving nonstationary shifts in stock-recruit relationships can provide valuable insights into temporal variation in fish population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Shifting temporal or non-linear relationships between angler behavior and fish population characteristics can mask population declines or produce unexpected regulation outcomes. We tested for hyperstability in seasonal and interannual trends in angler effort, catch, and harvest rates in bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) across hundreds of Wisconsin, USA, lakes from 1990 to 2019. Higher centrarchid angling rates in summer than fall or winter and increases in winter effort suggest some policies, like seasonal restrictions, may be more effective in limiting exploitation. Hyperstability was substantial across all species and metrics and did not vary seasonally, but bluegill and yellow perch harvest rates became slightly less hyperstable over time. Our findings suggest anglers may not self-regulate or respond to management unless changes in populations or policies are conspicuous. These patterns demonstrate how angler experiences respond to policy or fish population change, and caution against reliance on fisheries-dependent data to set management goals.},

	abstract = {Ecological complexity may improve ecosystem function, stability and adaptability to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Intraspecific trophic variation can represent a significant component of total community variation and can influence food web structure and function. Thus, understanding how trophic niches are partitioned between intraspecific and interspecific processes could improve our understanding of food web dynamics. We examined gut contents, fatty acids and stable isotope ratios in round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) across six sites in Lake Michigan, USA, to determine patterns in intra- and interspecific trophic composition (i.e., mean gut or fatty acid composition) and diversity (i.e., the diversity of gut items or fatty acids). We also examined relationships between fatty acid diversity and gut content characteristics to understand potential mechanisms shaping individual trophic phenotypes. There was significant variation in both trophic composition and diversity among sites, and individual and spatial variation was as important to total trophic variation as species identity. Round goby that consumed dreissenid mussels had more diverse fatty acid profiles than those that consumed other benthic invertebrates, whereas yellow perch fatty acid diversity was not related to gut content composition. Our results confirm that intraspecific variation in resource use can be as important to trophic dynamics as interspecific variation, and that spatial variation in lower level food web processes or habitat may strongly structure local food web dynamics. Individual-level examination of trophic diversity, in concert with trophic composition, could provide additional information about the resilience, function and adaptability of local food webs.},

	abstract = {Reproductive investment (e.g., egg size) is generally critical for the successful establishment of invasive species, with high variability often positively influencing success. Silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) are highly successful invasive fish on a global scale and threaten biodiversity in a wide range of freshwater habitats. However, factors influencing egg size variability in silver carp are not fully understood. We collected drifting silver carp eggs from the Wabash River, Indiana (USA) throughout the 2012 and 2013 spawning seasons to examine egg diameter variation was related to environmental factors and across time. The Wabash River is largely unregulated with few backwater habitats, and the resident silver carp population is relatively new. As a result, the Wabash River offers the opportunity to observe an expanding silver carp population in a river with a comparatively “natural” flow regime. Egg size was positively correlated with both embryo total length and yolk sac volume, indicating larger silver carp eggs contain larger, better-provisioned embryos at a given developmental stage. Eggs collected in 2013 were significantly larger than those collected in 2012 despite a decline in mean length of mature females. Relationships between egg diameter and environmental factors appear complex, with relationships varying between years. Silver carp eggs displayed high variability in diameter, with a mean coefficient of variation of 9.5\%. This high variation may reflect a diverse population of spawning females, but it may also constitute a reproductive strategy to facilitate egg transport across habitats and potentially reduce intraspecific competition. Such reproductive plasticity in silver carp and other invasive species is likely to be key for achieving reproductive success in newly invaded ecosystems despite the species’ naivety with novel and unpredictable environmental conditions therein.},

	abstract = {Genetic diversity has been hypothesized to promote fitness of individuals and populations, but few studies have examined how genetic diversity varies with ontogeny. We examined patterns in population and individual genetic diversity and the effect of genetic diversity on individual fitness among life stages (adults and juveniles) and populations of captive yellow perch (Perca flavescens) stocked into two ponds and allowed to spawn naturally. Significant genetic structure developed between adults and offspring in a single generation, even as heterozygosity and allelic richness remained relatively constant. Heterozygosity had no effect on adult growth or survival, but was significantly and consistently positively related to offspring length throughout the first year of life in one pond but not the other. The largest individuals in the pond exhibiting this positive relationship were more outbred than averaged size individuals and also more closely related to one another than they were to average-sized individuals, suggesting potential heritability of body size or spawn timing effects. These results indicate that the influence of heterozygosity may be mediated through an interaction, likely viability selection, between ontogeny and environment that is most important during early life. In addition, populations may experience significant genetic change within a single generation in captive environments, even when allowed to reproduce naturally. Accounting for the dynamic influences of genetic diversity on early life fitness could lead to improved understanding of recruitment and population dynamics in both wild and captive populations.},

Fish assemblages sampled with night electric fishing, gillnets and trapnets from 153 lakes were evaluated using summary indices of species composition, pairwise community similarity comparisons and multivariate ordination. For a given amount of effort, electric fishing had the highest species richness, while gillnets had higher diversity and evenness. Pairwise comparisons between gears revealed that (1) richness was positively correlated among all gears, (2) diversity and evenness were generally not correlated across gears and (3) electric fishing and trapnets captured more similar species than all other pairwise comparisons. Gear-specific multivariate correlation and ordination revealed that gillnet and electric fishing samples more similarly characterised variation in assemblages among lakes, while trapnets characterised assemblages along different gradients of species composition. These results indicate that either electric fishing or trapnetting can be used when assessing shallow-water assemblages for diversity or evenness, gillnets and either electric fishing or trapnets should be used for whole-lake assessments, and either gillnets or electric fishing should be used when evaluating regionwide variation in lake assemblages.},

	abstract = {In Lake Michigan, the unintended introduction of invasive species (e.g., zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha; quagga mussel, D. rostriformis bugensis; round goby, Neogobius melanostomus) and reduced nutrient loading has altered nutrient dynamics, system productivity, and community composition over the past two decades. These factors, together with sustained predation pressure, have contributed to declines of several forage fish species, including alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), which has dominated diets of the five primary salmonine species of Lake Michigan for the last 50 years. Salmonines that have inflexible, less complex diets may struggle if alewife declines continue. We analyzed stomach contents of salmonines collected throughout the main basin of Lake Michigan in 2015 and 2016 to investigate diet composition, diet diversity, and individual variation of alewife lengths consumed. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) almost exclusively consumed alewife and had lower diet diversities compared to the other four species, which consumed relatively high frequencies of round goby (brown trout, Salmo trutta; lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush), aquatic invertebrates (coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch) and terrestrial invertebrates (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) along with alewife. Although clear spatio-temporal feeding patterns existed, much of the variation in diet composition and diet diversity was expressed at the individual level. Salmonine populations consumed the entire size range of alewife that were available, whereas individual stomachs tended to contain a narrow range of alewife sizes. Due to their reliance on alewife, it is likely that Chinook salmon will be more negatively impacted than other salmonine species if alewife abundance continues to decline in Lake Michigan.},

In the Laurentian Great Lakes, invasive species and changing physical conditions have vastly altered local and regional food webs, leading to the potential for variation in energy flow up to large predators. To assess the potential that prey fish condition varies spatially, we examined patterns in proportion dry weight of prey fishes collected from Lake Michigan nearshore areas ({\textless}16 m) in 2010 and 2011. Absolute pairwise differences in dry weight of fishes were as high as 9\% between some of our sampling sites, but sites exhibiting relatively high or low values were patchily spread across the lake. The range of proportion dry weight values observed in our study do encompass previously-reported mean values; however, the values reported in our study are slightly lower than those previously reported for Lake Michigan. In contrast to previous studies, our analyses do not suggest that variation in prey fish condition exhibits a consistent spatial pattern around nearshore Lake Michigan, and high within-site variation of prey fish condition prevents strong conclusions about specific sites providing generally more (or less) energy-rich prey to predators.},

Using Wisconsin's diverse inland fisheries as a case study, management strategies for recreational and subsistence fisheries in response to climate change were reviewed within the RAD framework. Current strategies largely focus on resist actions, while future strategies may need to shift toward accept or direct actions. A participatory adaptive management framework and co-production of policies between state and tribal agencies could prioritise lakes for appropriate management action, with the goal of providing a landscape of diverse fishing opportunities.

To test the utility of an intensive management action to resist walleye loss, an experimental removal of 285,000 centrarchids from a 33-ha lake over 4 years was conducted while monitoring the fish community response. Centrarchid abundance declined and yellow perch Perca flavescens (Mitchill) increased, yet no evidence of walleye recruitment was observed.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Northern Highland Fishery Research Area (NHFRA), Vilas County, Wisconsin maintains a compulsory creel census that collects angler ZIP code information and species-specific angler catch rates from all visiting anglers. We used NHFRA angler ZIP code data from 2014 to 2019 on Escanaba, Nebish, and Pallette lakes to construct anglershed maps (i.e., highest density areas from which anglers traveled to fish the lakes) for muskellunge (Esox masquinongy), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), walleye (Sander vitreus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) to better understand angler travel patterns. We then tested for differences in species-specific catch rates among local (from counties surrounding or adjacent to the lakes, {\textless}100-km away), non-local (from counties in southern Wisconsin, {\textgreater}350-km away), and non-Wisconsin resident anglers. We hypothesized that local anglers would have higher overall species-specific catch rates due to proximity to the lakes and local knowledge than non-local or non-resident anglers. Anglersheds showed high use of the lakes by non-local anglers associated with major population centers in southern Wisconsin (Dane and Milwaukee counties) and adjacent states (Illinois and Minnesota). Species-specific catch rates did not differ appreciably among local, non-local, and non-resident anglers. Our results suggest that local knowledge may not be a good indicator of fishing trip success or elevated catch rates. Technology and angler information sources may level the playing field for anglers resulting in the homogenization of catch rates. Therefore, distance from a fishery may not aid in strengthening fisheries resilience.},

We provide a perspective on the possible implications for increasingly unpredictable aquatic habitats, including more frequent trophic asynchronies and altered hydrologic regimes, focusing on ice-off phenology in lakes. Increasingly frequent phenological extremes may limit the ability of organisms to optimize traits required to adapt to a warming environment. Using a unique, long-term ecological dataset on Escanaba Lake, WI, USA, as a case study, we show that the average date of ice-off is shifting earlier and becoming more variable, thus altering limnological conditions and yielding uncoupled food web responses with ramifications for fish spawn timing and recruitment success. A genes-to-ecosystems understanding of the responses of aquatic communities to increasingly variable phenology is needed. Our perspective suggests that management for diversity, at the intra- and interspecific levels, will become paramount for conserving resilient aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Inland fisheries face increasing threats to their sustainability. Despite speculation that depensation may exacerbate the effects of stressors on population resiliency, depensation has not been empirically explored in freshwater fisheries. Declining productivity of Walleye Sander vitreus populations in northern Wisconsin foreshadows an underlying change in naturally reproduced juvenile Walleye survival. We used long-term stock and recruitment data from lakes in the Ceded Territory of Wisconsin to quantify density-dependent trends in juvenile Walleye survival and tested for the prevalence of depensation using the q parameter of Liermann and Hilborn (1997). Of 82 Walleye populations evaluated, about half exhibited depensatory recruitment. An analysis of the global q for all populations examined suggested that the posterior probability of depensatory dynamics was about 0.89. In addition, there were few clear cases of compensation—most populations exhibited weak density dependence. The general lack of strong compensatory recruitment across Walleye populations could leave these stocks vulnerable to stressors and unresponsive to rehabilitation. We present multiple lines of evidence to suggest that depensation is a plausible phenomenon explaining declines in Walleye populations in the Ceded Territory of Wisconsin and may be implicated in other invisible collapses of freshwater fisheries.},

	abstract = {Recruitment depensation describes elevated juvenile mortality with declining adult population size which can prevent or delay stock recovery. Understanding the factors influencing when a population undergoes depensation provides resource agencies with targets for management action. Using estimates of depensation from 28 walleye (Sander vitreus, Percidae) populations in Wisconsin identified by Sass et al., (2021), we tested for potential abiotic and biotic predictors of walleye recruitment depensation. The best fitting model contained covariates for climate, land cover, and fish community composition, all interacting with the relative abundance of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides, Centrarchidae). The consistent interaction effect of largemouth bass across the other covariates suggests a key role of this species in regulating walleye recruitment dynamics at low population size. The risk of depensation was negatively correlated with largemouth bass abundance in our dataset, pointing towards continued challenges for walleye populations given the increasingly favorable social and environmental conditions for largemouth bass. Using the model, vulnerability to depensation was predicted for an additional 115 walleye lakes with insufficient data to directly estimate the risk of depensation. Predictions suggested that 73 prediction lakes are vulnerable to depensatory recruitment should population sizes significantly decrease. This predictive framework could be used to prioritize lakes for different management actions based on depensation strength and average adult population size. Lakes with low walleye abundances, but low risk of depensation, may be more likely to respond positively to management efforts and are likely better candidates than those where depensation effects are likely strong when abundance is low.},

	abstract = {Since the mid-2000s, recruitment of Walleye Sander vitreus in some northern Wisconsin lakes has declined, potentially because of climate-induced changes in lake environments. Yellow Perch Perca flavescens is also an ecologically and culturally important fish species in this region, but mechanisms driving Yellow Perch recruitment are unclear because of a lack of targeted sampling. Previous studies have suggested that recruitment of these two species may be regulated by similar factors, and observed declines in Walleye recruitment may be cause for concern about Yellow Perch recruitment. Our objectives were to determine if abiotic factors related to recruitment success were similar between Walleye and Yellow Perch populations in northern Wisconsin lakes and if the probability of successful Walleye recruitment was related to estimates of juvenile Yellow Perch abundance before Walleye recruitment declines were observed. We addressed these objectives using historical data from Wisconsin lakes. Random forest analysis incorporating lake-specific averages of predictor variables indicated that winter conditions (duration or severity), growing degree days, variation in spring temperatures, peak summer temperature, and Secchi depth were important predictors of recruitment success for both species. Logistic regression indicated that before Walleye recruitment declines were observed on some lakes (2000–2006), Walleye recruitment success was related to relative abundance of juvenile Yellow Perch in mini-fyke-net sampling. Our results indicate that landscape-level patterns in recruitment success for the two species are likely similar and additional research to understand Yellow Perch recruitment trends is warranted. Better information on Yellow Perch recruitment could contribute to a better understanding of Walleye recruitment trends as declines in Yellow Perch could influence prey availability and survival of age-0 Walleye. Furthermore, potential declines in Yellow Perch could lead to changes in the numbers and size of Yellow Perch caught by anglers, which may have implications for harvest management.},

We used Bayesian models of human behavior, a stage-structured population model, and a novel mortality integration approach to ask how human decisions affect animal population dynamics and conservation outcomes in the context of recreational fishing. Walleye (Sander vitreus) are a broadcast-spawning freshwater fish with large, slow-maturing females and small, fast-maturing males. We observed that simpler and less restrictive fishing regulations outperformed more complex and stricter regulations at conserving equilibrium adult female abundance and overall population abundance while still facilitating large harvests. This outcome was possible because angler behavior within the least restrictive regulation concentrated harvest on juveniles and adult males. Our findings indicate that, counter to intuitive expectations, moderate regulations can acheive conservation objectives when we account for the interaction of regulatory policy, human behavior, and animal life history. We suggest that integrating models of human behavior with models of animal life history and population dynamics will provide essential insights for conservation in ecosystems increasingly shaped by human decisions.},

Median deviation in mean length of age-3 fish was within 1 cm for the most specific HALK levels, and median deviation in total annual mortality was close to 0 for most species when borrowing occurred within HUC10 and HUC8 watersheds. Percent error in growth curves increased with data borrowing, but plateaued—or even decreased—for some species when data borrowing expanded across spatial levels.

However, comparisons of angler catch and harvest rates among seasons with disparate modes of fishing, like open water and ice angling in north-temperate lakes, are lacking. We used all available Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources point-intercept creel survey data during 1990–2020 to test for seasonal differences in the fisheries for five species targeted by open water and ice anglers in Wisconsin, USA, lakes (black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, northern pike Esox lucius, walleye Sander vitreus, yellow perch Perca flavescens). Specifically, we tested for: 1) species-specific differences in mean open water versus ice angling catch and harvest rates; 2) trends in species-specific mean open water versus ice angling catch and harvest rates during 1990–2020; and 3) monthly patterns in mean species-specific angler effort and catch rates. Mean angler catch rates of the five study species were significantly higher during the open water season and mostly temporally stable – only black crappie and bluegill open water catch rates and black crappie ice season catch rates significantly increased during 1990–2020. Mean angler harvest rates were significantly higher in the open water season for black crappie, bluegill, and walleye. Harvest rates were significantly higher during the ice season for northern pike and did not differ between seasons for yellow perch. Harvest rates were mostly temporally stable across species, although harvest rates declined for bluegill ice fishing and yellow perch in both seasons. Species-specific angler effort and catch rates mostly corresponded with seasonal (spring/early summer) vulnerabilities of our study species, although higher winter effort and catch rate patterns for northern pike and yellow perch may suggest unique harvest preferences for those species. Our results suggest that ice angling should not be assumed to have a negligible influence on fish populations in north-temperate lakes, fisheries-dependent and -independent monitoring data should be jointly considered when assessing fish population status, research on the human dimensions of ice fisheries is critically needed, and angler knowledge of seasonal fish vulnerabilities are generally coupled with higher fish catch rates.},

	abstract = {As anthropogenic disturbances rapidly change natural environments, species must respond to new selective pressures shaping rates of reproduction, growth, and mortality. One example is intense fisheries harvest, which can drive the evolution of heavily fished populations toward maturation at smaller sizes and younger ages. Changes in maturation have often been measured using probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs), which were originally designed to control for phenotypic plasticity while allowing for the detection of the evolution of maturation. However, multiple studies have highlighted issues with PMRN estimation, particularly with respect to their accuracy when parameterized with sparse data or when applied to populations experiencing myriad environmental stressors. We used a three-decade time series of Laurentian Great Lakes yellow perch (Perca flavescens Mitchill) data to develop a novel, hierarchical Bayesian PMRN estimation method that can explicitly account for these conceptual issues. Our results indicate that commercial fishing was a primary driver of maturation change in this population, and that the relaxation of harvest pressure via the closure of the commercial fishery in the late 1990s resulted in adaptation toward older ages and larger sizes at maturation within 2–3 generations. Future pairing of hierarchical Bayesian PMRN methods with genome-wide data will help reveal the genetic underpinnings of maturation, and could lead to new avenues for integrating PMRNs into fisheries management and policy.},

	abstract = {Walleye Sander vitreus natural recruitment has declined in northern Wisconsin lakes over time. Several factors have been implicated to explain Walleye natural recruitment declines in Wisconsin, including climate change, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides interactions, less desirable fish communities, production overharvest, and depensatory effects on recruit survival. Previous research in other systems has suggested that White Crappie Pomoxis annularis negatively influence Walleye recruitment, but interactions between Walleye recruitment and Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus have not been examined. We evaluated trends between Black Crappie and age‐0 Walleye relative abundance (catch per effort [CPE]) collected in northern Wisconsin during 1991–2017. Specifically, we tested for (1) trends in age‐0 Walleye and Black Crappie CPE over time, (2) a relationship between age‐0 Walleye and Black Crappie CPE, and (3) the influence of several abiotic and biotic covariates (including Black Crappie CPE) on age‐0 Walleye recruitment. Age‐0 Walleye CPE declined and Black Crappie CPE increased significantly during 1991–2017. Within lakes, the relationship between age‐0 Walleye and Black Crappie CPE showed a threshold effect such that age‐0 Walleye CPE was always low when Black Crappie CPE was high. Of the abiotic and biotic covariates tested to explain variability in the age‐0 Walleye and Black Crappie CPE relationship, only Black Crappie CPE was significant. Our results suggest that Black Crappie may negatively influence Walleye natural recruitment; however, we caution that our findings only reveal a pattern and not a mechanistic explanation for negative interactions between the species. Additional research is needed to test for mechanistic interactions between Walleye and Black Crappie and to inform comanagement of these species.},

However, the potential for competitive interactions between species may vary among systems, among seasons, or throughout the species’ ontogeny, requiring a thorough examination of trophic niches to determine whether overlap exists and to elucidate the likelihood of competition. The Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus is a popular game fish species across the United States, but recent invasions of White Perch Morone americana, which exploit a similar trophic niche, into southern reservoirs represent a major concern for the continued sustainability of Black Crappie fisheries. We examined the trophic niches of these species throughout their ontogeny in two North Carolina reservoirs during 2009 and 2010 using a combination of diet content and stable isotope analyses. Extensive and significant similarities in diet composition and isotopic niche overlap existed between Black Crappies and White Perch throughout their ontogeny and across seasons in both systems. Overlap was particularly high between smaller (\&lt;200‐mm), invertivorous Black Crappies and all sizes of White Perch. This overlap suggests that if invertebrate resources become limited, competition during the juvenile stage could reduce growth rates and survival of young Black Crappies. By evaluating variation in the trophic niches of each species among seasons, body sizes, and reservoirs, we conclude that the potential for competitive interactions between White Perch and Black Crappie is high in southern reservoirs. Management options to either reduce White Perch abundance or prevent their spread to novel habitats may be necessary to sustain native and supplemented Black Crappie populations that are potentially vulnerable to White Perch invasions.},

	abstract = {Spatially-correlated abiotic and biotic conditions can potentially induce synchrony in the dynamics of disparate populations or species. However, such potential synchrony among species or populations may be tempered by dynamics operating at finer temporal and spatial scales, as well as species-specific responses to environmental conditions. We examined within- and among-species synchrony in year-class strength across 130 lakes in northern Indiana over 30 years to evaluate the relative scale of potential synchrony and its possible ecological mechanisms in five recreationally important fish species: black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), redear sunfish (L. microlophus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Bluegill and black crappie recruitment was significantly positively correlated when the species coexisted, and relative year-class strength of both species was positively related to mean annual wind speed. However, there were few other instances of recruitment synchrony between or within species, regardless of whether synchrony was assessed within or among lake systems. In addition, habitat similarity and regional weather patterns also played a limited and inconsistent role in shaping recruitment strength or synchrony in these small inland systems. These results suggest that fish recruitment dynamics in small, inland systems are most often a function of system-specific biotic interactions that mask limited input from broader climatological influences, and that understanding recruitment in small lakes will require examinations on appropriately fine spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {The composition and structure of fish communities are affected by a variety of factors, both within the aquatic ecosystem and from the surrounding watershed. Many studies have examined what structures fish assemblages over broad spatial and environmental gradients. However, the influence of local environmental attributes on the observed variation in fish assemblages is less understood across finer spatial scales, where broad-scale climatic and anthropogenic factors are relatively similar. We used multiple linear regression to examine the relationships between environmental variables and various aspects of fish assemblages (including trophic function, community indices, and species composition) in 90 glacial lakes from northern Indiana, USA, from 1990 to 2010. Trophic structure and species composition were primarily related to water quality, whereas trophic level increased and omnivores declined as Secchi depth increased and phosphorus concentrations decreased. Species richness and diversity, in contrast, were positively linked to lake size and depth. We also found unique relationships among fish assemblages and environmental variables between samples collected using gill nets and night electrofishing, which may result from these gears sampling different assemblage components – therefore, relationships that were apparent in both sampling techniques (e.g., Secchi depth effects on trophic structure) may be the most robust and useful for improving aquatic ecosystem management on local scales.},

	abstract = {Understanding angler responses to fisheries management actions, such as regulation changes, has important implications for the effectiveness and efficacy of such management strategies. We examined whether vehicle counters could provide a relative index of angler effort, and we present a case study demonstrating use of vehicle counters to assess potential changes in angler effort associated with implementation of more restrictive panfish regulations in a subset of Wisconsin lakes.We compared vehicle counts with compulsory creel‐ and game‐camera‐based estimates of angler‐hours and the number of angling parties. During 2016, a series of more restrictive panfish regulations were implemented across 132 Wisconsin lakes. We deployed vehicle counters at a subset of lakes within each regulation type during preregulation (2015–2016) and postregulation (2021–2022) time periods to assess whether the distribution of angler effort (as indexed using vehicle counters) among regulation types shifted in response to regulation implementation.At lakes with paired vehicle counters and compulsory creel data, vehicle counts explained 57–72\% of the variation in daily angler effort (h) and 65–84\% of the variation in daily number of angling parties. Across lakes with paired vehicle counters and game cameras, vehicle counters explained 63–77\% of the variation in the number of apparent angling parties depending on how lakes were grouped (i.e., combined or stratified by regulation type); however, effectiveness of vehicle counters for explaining the variation in number of apparent angling parties varied at the individual lake level. We did not observe any systematic shifts in effort that would indicate a redistribution of angler effort in response to panfish regulations.Results suggest that given appropriate validation measures, vehicle counters could be used as a cost‐effective tool to index angler effort. Our findings indicate that a localized scale for implementation of specialized regulations may be appropriate given angler behaviors and preferences for Wisconsin panfish.Impact statementThis study demonstrates the utility of vehicle counters for indexing angler effort at a broad spatial scale and provides an application of how using vehicle counters to understand angler effort responses to fisheries management actions may help to guide the spatial scale of panfish harvest management in Wisconsin.},

We analyze modeled daily temperature profiles from 12,688 lakes in the US to track changes in thermal habitat of 60 lake fish species from different thermal guilds during 1980-2021. We quantify changes in each species’ preferred days, defined as the number of days per year when a lake contains the species’ preferred temperature. We find that cooler-water species are losing preferred days more rapidly than warmer-water species are gaining them. This asymmetric impact cannot be attributed to differences in geographic distribution among species; instead, it is linked to the seasonal dynamics of lake temperatures and increased thermal homogenization of the water column. The potential advantages of an increase in warmer-water species may not fully compensate for the losses in cooler-water species as warming continues, emphasizing the importance of mitigating climate change to support effective freshwater fisheries management.},

We used a 57-year time series of walleye (Sander vitreus) spawning, adult abundance, age-0 recruitment, and environmental data from Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, USA, to examine: (1) cues driving walleye spawning phenology; and (2) critical periods for age-0 walleye survival, including whether critical periods have changed over time. Walleye spawning was driven by an interaction between water temperature and photoperiod, potentially explaining previous research showing an inability of walleye to track increasingly early ice-off timing. We observed no consistent temperature or precipitation critical periods for walleye recruitment either in the full dataset, or when examining these relationships in different time periods. Our results suggests that walleye may be limited in their responsiveness to changing spring thermal environments owing to reliance on photoperiod cues, and their recruitment exhibits interannual context-dependencies, complicating attempts to accurately predict age-0 recruitment using predefined environmental variables.},
