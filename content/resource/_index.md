      title: Published data
      text: The research we do lies at the interface of basic and applied ecology.  Broadly, we work to understand how human interactions with freshwater ecosystems, including fishing, lake and fisheries management practices, and climate change, alter evolutionary and ecological processes in inland lakes, rivers, and the Great Lakes.  By understanding these responses, we can develop new approaches and practices for fisheries management in a rapidly changing landscape.<br>

        We combine field research, experimental approaches, and quantitative modeling to understand how anthropogenic stressors influence freshwater fisheries, and develop new approaches to help important fisheries deal with a changing world.
