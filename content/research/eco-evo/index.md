In a rapidly changing world, animals are constantly adapting. Human-induced selection gradients, like intense size-selective harvest, can alter the evolutionary trajectories of important fish life history traits, including growth or size- and age-at-maturation. We use experimental work, simulation modeling, and field studies to disentangle the relative effects of plasticity and evolution on these vital life history parameters.

Fisheries-induced evolution is rarely studied in inland waters.  We have been able to examine possible patterns of harvest-induced FIE in commercially-harvested yellow perch in the Great Lakes, shedding light on how and whether FIE played a role in the collapse of the Lake Michigan yellow perch fishery.  In addition, through a number of experiments and field studies, we've documented the strength of maternal effects on egg size, including how relationships between maternal size, environmental conditions like winter temperature, and maternal condition can influence egg quality with ramifications for population recruitment.  We continue our research by integrating genomic tools to begin to unravel the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic plasticity in life history.
