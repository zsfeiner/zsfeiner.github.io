Recruitment in fish might be considered a wicked problem.  The confluence of many, potentially important abiotic and biotic variables, inherent variability in population dynamics, and hard-to-track relationships make recruitment a difficult, but essential, problem to solve.

Our work has shown that recruitment variability can begin to be understood, particularly when flexible quantitative approaches can be leveraged against high quality data.  For instance, recruitment in Great Lakes rainbow smelt was shown to be highly non-stationary, with fluctuating population productivity offering new insight into their recruitment declines.  Population demography may also have an outsized role in some species, as in walleye, where adult condition and diversity in spawner size and age seem to improve recruitment success.  However, there are still questions to answer, such as how climate change may be altering traditional relationships between recruitment and abiotic variables like temperature, whether critical windows really exist for recruit survival (and how to identify them), and at what scales are biotic and abiotic drivers most important for fish recruitment.
