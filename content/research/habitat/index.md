title: Environmental drivers of fish assemblages
date: 2024-03-26

The abiotic and biotic drivers of the environments fish experience in lakes can have strong filtering effects on the species that can live there and the population dynamics of those species.  Using continental-, regional-, and lake-scale data on environmental conditions, we aim to develop new habitat management tools to promote fisheries outcomes in north-temperate systems.

Our work in this area is multi-faceted, covering everything from the abiotic and biotic drivers of fish recruitment and recruitment synchrony across landscapes, to interactions between aquatic plant communities and fish communities. Aquatic plants are an often underappreciated aspect of habitat for many fish species.  For example, we lack a strong understanding of how plants and fish interact, and how different plant communities may structure fish assemblages or population dynamics.  Layered over structural habitat, in-lake environments controlled by depth, productivity, or clarity also determine whether and how well a species may thrive in a particular place.  Population demography has also proven to be an important component of understanding changes in fish recruitment in the Upper Mideest. We collaborate widely with state agencies, tribes, and the Midwest Glacial Lakes Partnership to build data and models to answer questions about fish-habitat relationships, with the goal of creating additional tools to put in the lake management toolbox that can improve fisheries outcomes, strengthen resilience to climate change, and ensure lakes continue to provide critical ecosystem services.
