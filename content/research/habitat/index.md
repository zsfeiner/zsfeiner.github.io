The habitat available to fish in lakes can have strong filtering effects on the species that can live there, and the population dynamics of those species.  Using region-wide data on lake habitat, with a particular focus on aquatic plants, we aim to develop new habitat management tools to promote fisheries outcomes in north-temperate systems.

Aquatic plants are an often underappreciated aspect of habitat for many fish species.  We lack a strong understanding of how plants and fish interact, and how different plant communities may structure fish assemblages or population dynamics.  Layered over structural habitat, in-lake environments controlled by depth, productivity, or clarity also determine whether and how well a species may thrive in a particular place.  We collaborate widely with state agencies, tribes, and the Midwest Glacial Lakes Partnership to build data and models to answer questions about fish-habitat relationships, with the goal of creating additional tools to put in the lake management toolbox that can improve fisheries outcomes, strengthen resilience to climate change, and ensure lakes continue to provide critical ecosystem services.
