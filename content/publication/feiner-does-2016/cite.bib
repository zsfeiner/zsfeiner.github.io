 abstract = {Female yellow perch Perca flavescens exposed to three overwinter temperature regimes (4, 8 and 13° C) for 150 days spawned in markedly different proportions upon spring warming (37% of females in 4° C v. 64 and 91% in 8 and 13° C treatments, respectively), but exhibited no differences in fecundity, egg size or egg lipid content. Females held at 4° C also exhibited less within-clutch egg size variation than females held at 13° C. Moreover, eggs differed among temperature treatments in the overall proportions of 18 fatty acids, with the colder treatments resulting in potentially higher quality eggs containing more of the unsaturated fatty acids C16:1, C22:6-n3 and C18:2 cis. Female somatic condition also varied with temperature. Maternal somatic growth and protein content increased while lipid content decreased in 13° C compared to the colder treatments. There were, however, no differences among treatments in the fatty acid composition of maternal muscle. These results suggest that the temperatures experienced during winter may be less influential to P. flavescens egg size or number, which may exhibit relatively little plasticity in this species, but can alter both the number of females that spawn and the overall composition of eggs and maternal somatic tissues, which may have implications for future reproductive success.},
