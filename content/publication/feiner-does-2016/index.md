abstract: Female yellow perch Perca flavescens exposed to three overwinter temperature
  regimes (4, 8 and 13° C) for 150 days spawned in markedly different proportions
  upon spring warming (37% of females in 4° C v. 64 and 91% in 8 and 13° C treatments,
  respectively), but exhibited no differences in fecundity, egg size or egg lipid
  content. Females held at 4° C also exhibited less within-clutch egg size variation
  than females held at 13° C. Moreover, eggs differed among temperature treatments
  in the overall proportions of 18 fatty acids, with the colder treatments resulting
  in potentially higher quality eggs containing more of the unsaturated fatty acids
  C16:1, C22:6-n3 and C18:2 cis. Female somatic condition also varied with temperature.
  Maternal somatic growth and protein content increased while lipid content decreased
  in 13° C compared to the colder treatments. There were, however, no differences
  among treatments in the fatty acid composition of maternal muscle. These results
  suggest that the temperatures experienced during winter may be less influential
  to P. flavescens egg size or number, which may exhibit relatively little plasticity
  in this species, but can alter both the number of females that spawn and the overall
  composition of eggs and maternal somatic tissues, which may have implications for
  future reproductive success.
