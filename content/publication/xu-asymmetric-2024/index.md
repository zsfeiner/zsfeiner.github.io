abstract: Climate change is altering the thermal habitats of freshwater fish species.
  We analyze modeled daily temperature profiles from 12,688 lakes in the US to track
  changes in thermal habitat of 60 lake fish species from different thermal guilds
  during 1980-2021. We quantify changes in each species’ preferred days, defined as
  the number of days per year when a lake contains the species’ preferred temperature.
  We find that cooler-water species are losing preferred days more rapidly than warmer-water
  species are gaining them. This asymmetric impact cannot be attributed to differences
  in geographic distribution among species; instead, it is linked to the seasonal
  dynamics of lake temperatures and increased thermal homogenization of the water
  column. The potential advantages of an increase in warmer-water species may not
  fully compensate for the losses in cooler-water species as warming continues, emphasizing
  the importance of mitigating climate change to support effective freshwater fisheries
  management.
