abstract: Climate change is leading to shifts in not only the average timing of phenological
  events, but also their variance and predictability. Increasing phenological variability
  creates a stochastic environment that is critically understudied, particularly in
  aquatic ecosystems. We provide a perspective on the possible implications for increasingly
  unpredictable aquatic habitats, including more frequent trophic asynchronies and
  altered hydrologic regimes, focusing on ice-off phenology in lakes. Increasingly
  frequent phenological extremes may limit the ability of organisms to optimize traits
  required to adapt to a warming environment. Using a unique, long-term ecological
  dataset on Escanaba Lake, WI, USA, as a case study, we show that the average date
  of ice-off is shifting earlier and becoming more variable, thus altering limnological
  conditions and yielding uncoupled food web responses with ramifications for fish
  spawn timing and recruitment success. A genes-to-ecosystems understanding of the
  responses of aquatic communities to increasingly variable phenology is needed. Our
  perspective suggests that management for diversity, at the intra- and interspecific
  levels, will become paramount for conserving resilient aquatic ecosystems.
