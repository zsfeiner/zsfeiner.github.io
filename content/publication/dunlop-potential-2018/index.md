abstract: Fisheries are selective, capturing fish based on their body size, behaviour,
  life stage, or location. Over time, if harvest pressure is strong enough and variation
  in traits heritable, evolution can occur that affects key aspects of the ecology
  of fish stocks. Most compelling examples of rapid evolution in response to harvest
  have come from marine systems. Here, we review the state of knowledge on fisheries-induced
  evolution (FIE) in the Laurentian Great Lakes where subsistence, commercial, and
  recreational fisheries have operated for centuries. We conclude that stocks experienced
  harvest rates high enough and for long enough to undergo evolution. While historical
  fisheries exploited more juveniles, some contemporary Great Lakes fisheries target
  primarily adult size-classes thus reducing current selection for earlier maturation;
  however, other traits and behaviours could evolve (e.g., growth, timing of spawning,
  boldness). While commercial harvest previously dominated, recreational fishing is
  now expected to be a strong contributor to harvest selection in the Great Lakes.
  Environmental variation, density-dependence, invasive species, and the genetic legacy
  of population bottlenecks and stocking interact with, and make it more challenging
  to detect, FIE in the Great Lakes than in marine systems. Case studies are presented
  for Great Lakes stocks of yellow perch Perca flavescens and lake whitefish Coregonus
  clupeaformis for which FIE has been investigated. The evidence for FIE in the Great
  Lakes is currently sparse, potentially because of the low research focus on this
  topic or because of the interacting influence of environmental variation and anthropogenic
  stressors.
