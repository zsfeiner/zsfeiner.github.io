abstract: Genetic diversity has been hypothesized to promote fitness of individuals
  and populations, but few studies have examined how genetic diversity varies with
  ontogeny. We examined patterns in population and individual genetic diversity and
  the effect of genetic diversity on individual fitness among life stages (adults
  and juveniles) and populations of captive yellow perch (Perca flavescens) stocked
  into two ponds and allowed to spawn naturally. Significant genetic structure developed
  between adults and offspring in a single generation, even as heterozygosity and
  allelic richness remained relatively constant. Heterozygosity had no effect on adult
  growth or survival, but was significantly and consistently positively related to
  offspring length throughout the first year of life in one pond but not the other.
  The largest individuals in the pond exhibiting this positive relationship were more
  outbred than averaged size individuals and also more closely related to one another
  than they were to average-sized individuals, suggesting potential heritability of
  body size or spawn timing effects. These results indicate that the influence of
  heterozygosity may be mediated through an interaction, likely viability selection,
  between ontogeny and environment that is most important during early life. In addition,
  populations may experience significant genetic change within a single generation
  in captive environments, even when allowed to reproduce naturally. Accounting for
  the dynamic influences of genetic diversity on early life fitness could lead to
  improved understanding of recruitment and population dynamics in both wild and captive
  populations.
