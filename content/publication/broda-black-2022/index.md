abstract: Walleye Sander vitreus natural recruitment has declined in northern Wisconsin
  lakes over time. Several factors have been implicated to explain Walleye natural
  recruitment declines in Wisconsin, including climate change, Largemouth Bass Micropterus
  salmoides interactions, less desirable fish communities, production overharvest,
  and depensatory effects on recruit survival. Previous research in other systems
  has suggested that White Crappie Pomoxis annularis negatively influence Walleye
  recruitment, but interactions between Walleye recruitment and Black Crappie Pomoxis
  nigromaculatus have not been examined. We evaluated trends between Black Crappie
  and age-0 Walleye relative abundance (catch per effort [CPE]) collected in northern
  Wisconsin during 1991–2017. Specifically, we tested for (1) trends in age-0 Walleye
  and Black Crappie CPE over time, (2) a relationship between age-0 Walleye and Black
  Crappie CPE, and (3) the influence of several abiotic and biotic covariates (including
  Black Crappie CPE) on age-0 Walleye recruitment. Age-0 Walleye CPE declined and
  Black Crappie CPE increased significantly during 1991–2017. Within lakes, the relationship
  between age-0 Walleye and Black Crappie CPE showed a threshold effect such that
  age-0 Walleye CPE was always low when Black Crappie CPE was high. Of the abiotic
  and biotic covariates tested to explain variability in the age-0 Walleye and Black
  Crappie CPE relationship, only Black Crappie CPE was significant. Our results suggest
  that Black Crappie may negatively influence Walleye natural recruitment; however,
  we caution that our findings only reveal a pattern and not a mechanistic explanation
  for negative interactions between the species. Additional research is needed to
  test for mechanistic interactions between Walleye and Black Crappie and to inform
  comanagement of these species.
