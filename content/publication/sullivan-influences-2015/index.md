abstract: A variety of gears and analytical methods can be used to characterise lentic
  fish assemblages; however, the combined influence of gear type and analysis can
  affect conclusions about assemblage patterns. Fish assemblages sampled with night
  electric fishing, gillnets and trapnets from 153 lakes were evaluated using summary
  indices of species composition, pairwise community similarity comparisons and multivariate
  ordination. For a given amount of effort, electric fishing had the highest species
  richness, while gillnets had higher diversity and evenness. Pairwise comparisons
  between gears revealed that (1) richness was positively correlated among all gears,
  (2) diversity and evenness were generally not correlated across gears and (3) electric
  fishing and trapnets captured more similar species than all other pairwise comparisons.
  Gear-specific multivariate correlation and ordination revealed that gillnet and
  electric fishing samples more similarly characterised variation in assemblages among
  lakes, while trapnets characterised assemblages along different gradients of species
  composition. These results indicate that either electric fishing or trapnetting
  can be used when assessing shallow-water assemblages for diversity or evenness,
  gillnets and either electric fishing or trapnets should be used for whole-lake assessments,
  and either gillnets or electric fishing should be used when evaluating regionwide
  variation in lake assemblages.
