abstract: Recruitment depensation describes elevated juvenile mortality with declining
  adult population size which can prevent or delay stock recovery. Understanding the
  factors influencing when a population undergoes depensation provides resource agencies
  with targets for management action. Using estimates of depensation from 28 walleye
  (Sander vitreus, Percidae) populations in Wisconsin identified by Sass et al., (2021),
  we tested for potential abiotic and biotic predictors of walleye recruitment depensation.
  The best fitting model contained covariates for climate, land cover, and fish community
  composition, all interacting with the relative abundance of largemouth bass (Micropterus
  salmoides, Centrarchidae). The consistent interaction effect of largemouth bass
  across the other covariates suggests a key role of this species in regulating walleye
  recruitment dynamics at low population size. The risk of depensation was negatively
  correlated with largemouth bass abundance in our dataset, pointing towards continued
  challenges for walleye populations given the increasingly favorable social and environmental
  conditions for largemouth bass. Using the model, vulnerability to depensation was
  predicted for an additional 115 walleye lakes with insufficient data to directly
  estimate the risk of depensation. Predictions suggested that 73 prediction lakes
  are vulnerable to depensatory recruitment should population sizes significantly
  decrease. This predictive framework could be used to prioritize lakes for different
  management actions based on depensation strength and average adult population size.
  Lakes with low walleye abundances, but low risk of depensation, may be more likely
  to respond positively to management efforts and are likely better candidates than
  those where depensation effects are likely strong when abundance is low.
