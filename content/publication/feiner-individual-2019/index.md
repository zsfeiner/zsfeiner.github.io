abstract: Ecological complexity may improve ecosystem function, stability and adaptability
  to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Intraspecific trophic variation can represent
  a significant component of total community variation and can influence food web
  structure and function. Thus, understanding how trophic niches are partitioned between
  intraspecific and interspecific processes could improve our understanding of food
  web dynamics. We examined gut contents, fatty acids and stable isotope ratios in
  round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) across six
  sites in Lake Michigan, USA, to determine patterns in intra- and interspecific trophic
  composition (i.e., mean gut or fatty acid composition) and diversity (i.e., the
  diversity of gut items or fatty acids). We also examined relationships between fatty
  acid diversity and gut content characteristics to understand potential mechanisms
  shaping individual trophic phenotypes. There was significant variation in both trophic
  composition and diversity among sites, and individual and spatial variation was
  as important to total trophic variation as species identity. Round goby that consumed
  dreissenid mussels had more diverse fatty acid profiles than those that consumed
  other benthic invertebrates, whereas yellow perch fatty acid diversity was not related
  to gut content composition. Our results confirm that intraspecific variation in
  resource use can be as important to trophic dynamics as interspecific variation,
  and that spatial variation in lower level food web processes or habitat may strongly
  structure local food web dynamics. Individual-level examination of trophic diversity,
  in concert with trophic composition, could provide additional information about
  the resilience, function and adaptability of local food webs.
