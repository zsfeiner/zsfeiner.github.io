abstract: Decision-makers in inland fisheries management must balance ecologically
  and socially palatable objectives for ecosystem services within financial or physical
  constraints. Climate change has transformed the potential range of ecosystem services
  available. The Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework offers a foundation for responding
  to climate-induced ecosystem modification; however, ecosystem trajectories and current
  practices must be understood to improve future decisions. Using Wisconsin's diverse
  inland fisheries as a case study, management strategies for recreational and subsistence
  fisheries in response to climate change were reviewed within the RAD framework.
  Current strategies largely focus on resist actions, while future strategies may
  need to shift toward accept or direct actions. A participatory adaptive management
  framework and co-production of policies between state and tribal agencies could
  prioritise lakes for appropriate management action, with the goal of providing a
  landscape of diverse fishing opportunities. This knowledge co-production represents
  a process of social learning requiring substantial investments of funding and time.
