abstract: The composition and structure of fish communities are affected by a variety
  of factors, both within the aquatic ecosystem and from the surrounding watershed.
  Many studies have examined what structures fish assemblages over broad spatial and
  environmental gradients. However, the influence of local environmental attributes
  on the observed variation in fish assemblages is less understood across finer spatial
  scales, where broad-scale climatic and anthropogenic factors are relatively similar.
  We used multiple linear regression to examine the relationships between environmental
  variables and various aspects of fish assemblages (including trophic function, community
  indices, and species composition) in 90 glacial lakes from northern Indiana, USA,
  from 1990 to 2010. Trophic structure and species composition were primarily related
  to water quality, whereas trophic level increased and omnivores declined as Secchi
  depth increased and phosphorus concentrations decreased. Species richness and diversity,
  in contrast, were positively linked to lake size and depth. We also found unique
  relationships among fish assemblages and environmental variables between samples
  collected using gill nets and night electrofishing, which may result from these
  gears sampling different assemblage components – therefore, relationships that were
  apparent in both sampling techniques (e.g., Secchi depth effects on trophic structure)
  may be the most robust and useful for improving aquatic ecosystem management on
  local scales.
