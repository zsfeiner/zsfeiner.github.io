abstract: Lake ecosystems are shifting due to many drivers including climate change
  and landscape-scale habitat disturbance, diminishing their potential to support
  some fisheries. Walleye Sander vitreus (Mitchill) populations, which support recreational
  and tribal fisheries across North America, have declined in some lakes. Climate
  change, harvest, invasive species and concurrent increases in warm-water fishes
  (e.g. Centrarchidae) may have contributed to declines. To test the utility of an
  intensive management action to resist walleye loss, an experimental removal of 285,000
  centrarchids from a 33-ha lake over 4 years was conducted while monitoring the fish
  community response. Centrarchid abundance declined and yellow perch Perca flavescens
  (Mitchill) increased, yet no evidence of walleye recruitment was observed. These
  findings explore the feasibility of intensive resistance as a management strategy
  in supporting walleye facing environmental change and provide a platform for management
  discussions to move beyond resist strategies in the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework
  to navigate ecosystem change.
