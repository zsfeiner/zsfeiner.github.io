abstract: The detrimental impacts of invasive species often occur through deleterious
  trophic interactions (e.g., competition) with native species. However, the potential
  for competitive interactions between species may vary among systems, among seasons,
  or throughout the species’ ontogeny, requiring a thorough examination of trophic
  niches to determine whether overlap exists and to elucidate the likelihood of competition.
  The Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus is a popular game fish species across the
  United States, but recent invasions of White Perch Morone americana, which exploit
  a similar trophic niche, into southern reservoirs represent a major concern for
  the continued sustainability of Black Crappie fisheries. We examined the trophic
  niches of these species throughout their ontogeny in two North Carolina reservoirs
  during 2009 and 2010 using a combination of diet content and stable isotope analyses.
  Extensive and significant similarities in diet composition and isotopic niche overlap
  existed between Black Crappies and White Perch throughout their ontogeny and across
  seasons in both systems. Overlap was particularly high between smaller (textless200-mm),
  invertivorous Black Crappies and all sizes of White Perch. This overlap suggests
  that if invertebrate resources become limited, competition during the juvenile stage
  could reduce growth rates and survival of young Black Crappies. By evaluating variation
  in the trophic niches of each species among seasons, body sizes, and reservoirs,
  we conclude that the potential for competitive interactions between White Perch
  and Black Crappie is high in southern reservoirs. Management options to either reduce
  White Perch abundance or prevent their spread to novel habitats may be necessary
  to sustain native and supplemented Black Crappie populations that are potentially
  vulnerable to White Perch invasions.
