abstract: Offspring size determines offspring survival rates; thus, understanding
  factors influencing offspring size variability could elucidate variation in population
  dynamics. Offspring size variation is influenced through multigenerational adaptation
  to local environments and within-lifetime plastic responses to environmental variability
  and maternal effects among individuals. Moreover, offspring size variation may represent
  trade-offs in energy allocation within individuals that influence lifetime reproductive
  success. However, the mechanisms whereby environmental conditions influence offspring
  size, e.g., via inducing adaptive and plastic variation in population-scale maternal
  effects, remain poorly understood. We evaluated intra-specific variation in maternal
  effects, egg size, and intra-individual egg size variation in six populations of
  walleye (Sander vitreus) and related among- and within-population patterns to thermal
  conditions. Egg size was conserved within populations and negatively related to
  long-term thermal conditions among populations, while maternal effect strengths
  were positively related to thermal conditions, suggesting that populations inhabiting
  warmer environments adapted to produce smaller eggs but stronger maternal effects.
  Within a population, egg size was positively related to colder winters, suggesting
  cold winters may alter egg size through effects on maternal condition or as an adaptive
  maternal effect to improve offspring survival. Intra-individual egg size variation
  varied little among populations or with female size, but declined with increasing
  summer and decreasing winter temperatures. Our result suggests that environmental
  conditions could impact not only short-term offspring production but also spur adaptive
  changes in offspring phenotypes. Thus, it is necessary to account for adaptive responses
  to predict population dynamics under environmental changes.
