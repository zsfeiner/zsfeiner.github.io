abstract: Since the mid-2000s, recruitment of Walleye Sander vitreus in some northern
  Wisconsin lakes has declined, potentially because of climate-induced changes in
  lake environments. Yellow Perch Perca flavescens is also an ecologically and culturally
  important fish species in this region, but mechanisms driving Yellow Perch recruitment
  are unclear because of a lack of targeted sampling. Previous studies have suggested
  that recruitment of these two species may be regulated by similar factors, and observed
  declines in Walleye recruitment may be cause for concern about Yellow Perch recruitment.
  Our objectives were to determine if abiotic factors related to recruitment success
  were similar between Walleye and Yellow Perch populations in northern Wisconsin
  lakes and if the probability of successful Walleye recruitment was related to estimates
  of juvenile Yellow Perch abundance before Walleye recruitment declines were observed.
  We addressed these objectives using historical data from Wisconsin lakes. Random
  forest analysis incorporating lake-specific averages of predictor variables indicated
  that winter conditions (duration or severity), growing degree days, variation in
  spring temperatures, peak summer temperature, and Secchi depth were important predictors
  of recruitment success for both species. Logistic regression indicated that before
  Walleye recruitment declines were observed on some lakes (2000â€“2006), Walleye recruitment
  success was related to relative abundance of juvenile Yellow Perch in mini-fyke-net
  sampling. Our results indicate that landscape-level patterns in recruitment success
  for the two species are likely similar and additional research to understand Yellow
  Perch recruitment trends is warranted. Better information on Yellow Perch recruitment
  could contribute to a better understanding of Walleye recruitment trends as declines
  in Yellow Perch could influence prey availability and survival of age-0 Walleye.
  Furthermore, potential declines in Yellow Perch could lead to changes in the numbers
  and size of Yellow Perch caught by anglers, which may have implications for harvest
  management.
