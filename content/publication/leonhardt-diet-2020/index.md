abstract: In Lake Michigan, the unintended introduction of invasive species (e.g.,
  zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha; quagga mussel, D. rostriformis bugensis; round
  goby, Neogobius melanostomus) and reduced nutrient loading has altered nutrient
  dynamics, system productivity, and community composition over the past two decades.
  These factors, together with sustained predation pressure, have contributed to declines
  of several forage fish species, including alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), which
  has dominated diets of the five primary salmonine species of Lake Michigan for the
  last 50 years. Salmonines that have inflexible, less complex diets may struggle
  if alewife declines continue. We analyzed stomach contents of salmonines collected
  throughout the main basin of Lake Michigan in 2015 and 2016 to investigate diet
  composition, diet diversity, and individual variation of alewife lengths consumed.
  Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) almost exclusively consumed alewife and
  had lower diet diversities compared to the other four species, which consumed relatively
  high frequencies of round goby (brown trout, Salmo trutta; lake trout, Salvelinus
  namaycush), aquatic invertebrates (coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch) and terrestrial
  invertebrates (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) along with alewife. Although
  clear spatio-temporal feeding patterns existed, much of the variation in diet composition
  and diet diversity was expressed at the individual level. Salmonine populations
  consumed the entire size range of alewife that were available, whereas individual
  stomachs tended to contain a narrow range of alewife sizes. Due to their reliance
  on alewife, it is likely that Chinook salmon will be more negatively impacted than
  other salmonine species if alewife abundance continues to decline in Lake Michigan.
