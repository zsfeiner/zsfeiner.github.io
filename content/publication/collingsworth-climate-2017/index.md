abstract: The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America provide valuable ecosystem services,
  including fisheries, to the surrounding population. Given the prevalence of other
  anthropogenic stressors that have historically affected the fisheries of the Great
  Lakes (e.g., eutrophication, invasive species, overfishing), climate change is often
  viewed as a long-term stressor and, subsequently, may not always be prioritized
  by managers and researchers. However, climate change has the potential to negatively
  affect fish and fisheries in the Great Lakes through its influence on habitat. In
  this paper, we (1) summarize projected changes in climate and fish habitat in the
  Great Lakes; (2) summarize fish responses to climate change in the Great Lakes;
  (3) describe key interactions between climate change and other stressors relevant
  to Great Lakes fish, and (4) summarize how climate change can be incorporated into
  fisheries management. In general, fish habitat is projected to be characterized
  by warmer temperatures throughout the water column, less ice cover, longer periods
  of stratification, and more frequent and widespread periods of bottom hypoxia in
  productive areas of the Great Lakes. Based solely on thermal habitat, fish populations
  theoretically could experience prolonged optimal growth environment within a changing
  climate, however, models that assess physical habitat influences at specific life
  stages convey a more complex picture. Looking at specific interactions with other
  stressors, climate change may exacerbate the negative impacts of both eutrophication
  and invasive species for fish habitat in the Great Lakes. Although expanding monitoring
  and research to consider climate change interactions with currently studied stressors,
  may offer managers the best opportunity to keep the valuable Great Lakes fisheries
  sustainable, this expansion is globally applicable for large lake ecosystem dealing
  with multiple stressors in the face of continued human-driven changes.
