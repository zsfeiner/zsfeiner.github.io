abstract: Fish stock-recruitment dynamics may be difficult to elucidate because of
  nonstationary relationships resulting from shifting environmental conditions and
  fluctuations in important vital rates such as individual growth or maturation. The
  Great Lakes have experienced environmental stressors that may have changed population
  demographics and stock-recruitment relationships while causing the declines of several
  prey fish species, including rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). We investigated changes
  in the size and maturation of rainbow smelt in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron and
  recruitment dynamics of the Lake Michigan stock over the past four decades. Mean
  lengths and length-at-maturation of rainbow smelt generally declined over time in
  both lakes. To evaluate recruitment, we used both a Ricker model and a Kalman filter-random
  walk (KF-RW) model which incorporated nonstationarity in stock productivity by allowing
  the productivity term to vary over time. The KF-RW model explained nearly four times
  more variation in recruitment than the Ricker model, indicating the productivity
  of the Lake Michigan stock has increased. By accounting for this nonstationarity,
  we were able identify significant variations in stock productivity, evaluate its
  importance to rainbow smelt recruitment, and speculate on potential environmental
  causes for the shift. Our results suggest that investigating mechanisms driving
  nonstationary shifts in stock-recruit relationships can provide valuable insights
  into temporal variation in fish population dynamics.
