abstract: 'Spatially-correlated abiotic and biotic conditions can potentially induce
  synchrony in the dynamics of disparate populations or species. However, such potential
  synchrony among species or populations may be tempered by dynamics operating at
  finer temporal and spatial scales, as well as species-specific responses to environmental
  conditions. We examined within- and among-species synchrony in year-class strength
  across 130 lakes in northern Indiana over 30 years to evaluate the relative scale
  of potential synchrony and its possible ecological mechanisms in five recreationally
  important fish species: black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), bluegill (Lepomis
  macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), redear sunfish (L. microlophus),
  and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Bluegill and black crappie recruitment was
  significantly positively correlated when the species coexisted, and relative year-class
  strength of both species was positively related to mean annual wind speed. However,
  there were few other instances of recruitment synchrony between or within species,
  regardless of whether synchrony was assessed within or among lake systems. In addition,
  habitat similarity and regional weather patterns also played a limited and inconsistent
  role in shaping recruitment strength or synchrony in these small inland systems.
  These results suggest that fish recruitment dynamics in small, inland systems are
  most often a function of system-specific biotic interactions that mask limited input
  from broader climatological influences, and that understanding recruitment in small
  lakes will require examinations on appropriately fine spatial and temporal scales.'
