abstract: As anthropogenic disturbances rapidly change natural environments, species
  must respond to new selective pressures shaping rates of reproduction, growth, and
  mortality. One example is intense fisheries harvest, which can drive the evolution
  of heavily fished populations toward maturation at smaller sizes and younger ages.
  Changes in maturation have often been measured using probabilistic maturation reaction
  norms (PMRNs), which were originally designed to control for phenotypic plasticity
  while allowing for the detection of the evolution of maturation. However, multiple
  studies have highlighted issues with PMRN estimation, particularly with respect
  to their accuracy when parameterized with sparse data or when applied to populations
  experiencing myriad environmental stressors. We used a three-decade time series
  of Laurentian Great Lakes yellow perch (Perca flavescens Mitchill) data to develop
  a novel, hierarchical Bayesian PMRN estimation method that can explicitly account
  for these conceptual issues. Our results indicate that commercial fishing was a
  primary driver of maturation change in this population, and that the relaxation
  of harvest pressure via the closure of the commercial fishery in the late 1990s
  resulted in adaptation toward older ages and larger sizes at maturation within 2â€“3
  generations. Future pairing of hierarchical Bayesian PMRN methods with genome-wide
  data will help reveal the genetic underpinnings of maturation, and could lead to
  new avenues for integrating PMRNs into fisheries management and policy.
