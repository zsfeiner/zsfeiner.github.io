abstract: Understanding angler responses to fisheries management actions, such as
  regulation changes, has important implications for the effectiveness and efficacy
  of such management strategies. We examined whether vehicle counters could provide
  a relative index of angler effort, and we present a case study demonstrating use
  of vehicle counters to assess potential changes in angler effort associated with
  implementation of more restrictive panfish regulations in a subset of Wisconsin
  lakes.We compared vehicle counts with compulsory creel‐ and game‐camera‐based estimates
  of angler‐hours and the number of angling parties. During 2016, a series of more
  restrictive panfish regulations were implemented across 132 Wisconsin lakes. We
  deployed vehicle counters at a subset of lakes within each regulation type during
  preregulation (2015–2016) and postregulation (2021–2022) time periods to assess
  whether the distribution of angler effort (as indexed using vehicle counters) among
  regulation types shifted in response to regulation implementation.At lakes with
  paired vehicle counters and compulsory creel data, vehicle counts explained 57–72%
  of the variation in daily angler effort (h) and 65–84% of the variation in daily
  number of angling parties. Across lakes with paired vehicle counters and game cameras,
  vehicle counters explained 63–77% of the variation in the number of apparent angling
  parties depending on how lakes were grouped (i.e., combined or stratified by regulation
  type); however, effectiveness of vehicle counters for explaining the variation in
  number of apparent angling parties varied at the individual lake level. We did not
  observe any systematic shifts in effort that would indicate a redistribution of
  angler effort in response to panfish regulations.Results suggest that given appropriate
  validation measures, vehicle counters could be used as a cost‐effective tool to
  index angler effort. Our findings indicate that a localized scale for implementation
  of specialized regulations may be appropriate given angler behaviors and preferences
  for Wisconsin panfish.Impact statementThis study demonstrates the utility of vehicle
  counters for indexing angler effort at a broad spatial scale and provides an application
  of how using vehicle counters to understand angler effort responses to fisheries
  management actions may help to guide the spatial scale of panfish harvest management
  in Wisconsin.
