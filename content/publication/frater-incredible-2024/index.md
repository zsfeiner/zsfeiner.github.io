abstract: Understanding age and growth are important for fisheries science and management;
  however, age data are not routinely collected for many populations. We propose and
  test a method of borrowing age–length data across increasingly broader spatiotemporal
  levels to create a hierarchical age–length key (HALK). We assessed this method by
  comparing growth and mortality metrics to those estimated from lake–year age–length
  keys ages using seven common freshwater fish species across the upper Midwestern
  United States. Levels used for data borrowing began most specifically by borrowing
  within lake across time and increased in breadth to include data within the Hydrologic
  Unit Code (HUC) 10 watershed, HUC8 watershed, Level III Ecoregion, and finally a
  species-wide data ALK using all available data with our study for a species. Median
  deviation in mean length of age-3 fish was within 1 cm for the most specific HALK
  levels, and median deviation in total annual mortality was close to 0 for most species
  when borrowing occurred within HUC10 and HUC8 watersheds. Percent error in growth
  curves increased with data borrowing, but plateaued—or even decreased—for some species
  when data borrowing expanded across spatial levels. We present the HALK as a method
  for gaining age information about a fishery when age data are unavailable.
