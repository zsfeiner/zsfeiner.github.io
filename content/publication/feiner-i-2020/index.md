abstract: Shifting temporal or non-linear relationships between angler behavior and
  fish population characteristics can mask population declines or produce unexpected
  regulation outcomes. We tested for hyperstability in seasonal and interannual trends
  in angler effort, catch, and harvest rates in bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), black
  crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) across hundreds
  of Wisconsin, USA, lakes from 1990 to 2019. Higher centrarchid angling rates in
  summer than fall or winter and increases in winter effort suggest some policies,
  like seasonal restrictions, may be more effective in limiting exploitation. Hyperstability
  was substantial across all species and metrics and did not vary seasonally, but
  bluegill and yellow perch harvest rates became slightly less hyperstable over time.
  Our findings suggest anglers may not self-regulate or respond to management unless
  changes in populations or policies are conspicuous. These patterns demonstrate how
  angler experiences respond to policy or fish population change, and caution against
  reliance on fisheries-dependent data to set management goals.
