abstract: Maternal effects have been observed to interact with genotypic and environmental
  influences to structure offspring phenotypes across a wide variety of taxa. In fishes,
  maternal effects may be especially important due to their potential influence on
  development and survival during early ontogeny – a period with high potential for
  population regulation. While previous studies have confirmed that maternal effects
  on offspring phenotype are common in fishes, the consistency with which they positively
  affect offspring fitness throughout early ontogeny remains largely unknown. We examined
  maternal effects on offspring fitness by quantifying relationships between maternal
  (length, mass and age), egg (diameter, mass and density) and larval traits (length,
  yolk-sac volume and survival) in yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Consistent with
  several past studies, positive relationships among maternal and egg traits were
  evident. While egg mass was positively related to larval size at hatching, direct
  relationships between maternal and larval metrics were not apparent. Larval survival
  appeared to have two critical periods; in contrast with expectations, survival in
  the first 5 days posthatch was strongly negatively related to female size and age,
  while survival over the following 9 days was unrelated to maternal traits. Throughout
  the study, survival was positively related to yolk-sac volume. Our unexpected observation
  of a negative relationship between maternal size and age and initial larval survival
  indicates that maternal effects may not be consistent throughout larval ontogeny.
  In fact, maternal effects appear to be dynamic influences on offspring fitness,
  and may have complex effects on individual- and population-level reproductive success.
