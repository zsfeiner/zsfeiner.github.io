abstract: The phenology of critical biological events in aquatic ecosystems is rapidly
  shifting due to climate change. Growing variability in phenological cues can increase
  the likelihood of trophic mismatches (i.e., mismatches in the timing of peak prey
  and predator abundances), causing recruitment failures in important fisheries. We
  assessed changes in the spawning phenology of walleye (Sander vitreus) in 194 Midwest
  US lakes to investigate factors influencing walleye phenological responses to climate
  change and associated climate variability, including ice-off timing, lake physical
  characteristics, and population stocking history. Ice-off phenology shifted earlier,
  about three times faster than walleye spawning phenology over time. Spawning phenology
  deviations from historic averages increased in magnitude over time, and large deviations
  were associated with poor offspring survival. Our results foreshadow the risks of
  increasingly frequent natural recruitment failures due to mismatches between historically
  tightly coupled spawning and ice-off phenology.
