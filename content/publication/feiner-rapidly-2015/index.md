abstract: 'Size-selective harvest of fish stocks can lead to maturation at smaller
  sizes and younger ages, which may depress stock productivity and recovery. Such
  changes in maturation may be very slow to reverse, even following complete fisheries
  closures. We evaluated temporal trends in maturation of five Great Lakes stocks
  of yellow perch (Perca flavescens Mitchill) using indices that attempt to disentangle
  plastic and evolutionary changes in maturation: age at 50% maturity and probabilistic
  maturation reaction norms (PMRNs). Four populations were fished commercially throughout
  the time series, while the Lake Michigan fishery was closed following a stock collapse.
  We documented rapid increases in PMRNs of the Lake Michigan stock coincident with
  the commercial fishery closure. Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron PMRNs also increased
  following reduced harvest, while Lake Erie populations were continuously fished
  and showed little change. The rapid response of maturation may have been enhanced
  by the short generation time of yellow perch and potential gene flow between northern
  and southern Lake Michigan, in addition to potential reverse adaptation following
  the fishing moratorium. These results suggest that some fish stocks may retain the
  ability to recover from fisheries-induced life history shifts following fishing
  moratoria.'
