abstract: 'Increased environmental variability driven by climate change threatens
  species adapted to seasonal climates. Understanding whether changing environmental
  cues influence life history phenology and the importance of environmental characteristics
  on recruitment could inform population vulnerability. We used a 57-year time series
  of walleye (Sander vitreus) spawning, adult abundance, age-0 recruitment, and environmental
  data from Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, USA, to examine: (1) cues driving walleye spawning
  phenology; and (2) critical periods for age-0 walleye survival, including whether
  critical periods have changed over time. Walleye spawning was driven by an interaction
  between water temperature and photoperiod, potentially explaining previous research
  showing an inability of walleye to track increasingly early ice-off timing. We observed
  no consistent temperature or precipitation critical periods for walleye recruitment
  either in the full dataset, or when examining these relationships in different time
  periods. Our results suggests that walleye may be limited in their responsiveness
  to changing spring thermal environments owing to reliance on photoperiod cues, and
  their recruitment exhibits interannual context-dependencies, complicating attempts
  to accurately predict age-0 recruitment using predefined environmental variables.'
