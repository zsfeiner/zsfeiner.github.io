abstract: Reproductive investment (e.g., egg size) is generally critical for the successful
  establishment of invasive species, with high variability often positively influencing
  success. Silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) are highly
  successful invasive fish on a global scale and threaten biodiversity in a wide range
  of freshwater habitats. However, factors influencing egg size variability in silver
  carp are not fully understood. We collected drifting silver carp eggs from the Wabash
  River, Indiana (USA) throughout the 2012 and 2013 spawning seasons to examine egg
  diameter variation was related to environmental factors and across time. The Wabash
  River is largely unregulated with few backwater habitats, and the resident silver
  carp population is relatively new. As a result, the Wabash River offers the opportunity
  to observe an expanding silver carp population in a river with a comparatively “natural”
  flow regime. Egg size was positively correlated with both embryo total length and
  yolk sac volume, indicating larger silver carp eggs contain larger, better-provisioned
  embryos at a given developmental stage. Eggs collected in 2013 were significantly
  larger than those collected in 2012 despite a decline in mean length of mature females.
  Relationships between egg diameter and environmental factors appear complex, with
  relationships varying between years. Silver carp eggs displayed high variability
  in diameter, with a mean coefficient of variation of 9.5%. This high variation may
  reflect a diverse population of spawning females, but it may also constitute a reproductive
  strategy to facilitate egg transport across habitats and potentially reduce intraspecific
  competition. Such reproductive plasticity in silver carp and other invasive species
  is likely to be key for achieving reproductive success in newly invaded ecosystems
  despite the species’ naivety with novel and unpredictable environmental conditions
  therein.
