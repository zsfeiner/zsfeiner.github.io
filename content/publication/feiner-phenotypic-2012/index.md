abstract: Successful invasive species must pass through several invasion stages, and
  life history or trophic strategies allowing for successful transitions may change
  as the species advances from one stage to the next. To evaluate the role of life
  history shifts in the invasion success of white perch (Morone americana), age and
  length at maturity, gonadosomatic index, and growth were compared across three invasive
  reservoir populations ranging from 1, 11, and 21Â years since initial detection.
  Individuals in the newly introduced population exhibited increased growth and had
  higher mean reproductive investment than the two established populations across
  both study years. Individuals in the newest population also matured earlier than
  those in the older populations in 2009, but maturity schedules did not differ in
  2010, possibly due to changes in environmental conditions causing life history shifts
  in both older populations. Overall, it appears that life history plasticity confers
  an important advantage to invasive species, allowing them to adapt for successful
  transitions throughout the invasion process, as well as to local conditions within
  the invaded system once they become fully integrated into established communities.
