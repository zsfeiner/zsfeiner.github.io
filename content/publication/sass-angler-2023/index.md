abstract: 'Understanding seasonal differences in species-specific vulnerabilities
  to recreational angling can be important for informing sustainable fisheries management
  practices, like fishing seasons or season-specific regulations. However, comparisons
  of angler catch and harvest rates among seasons with disparate modes of fishing,
  like open water and ice angling in north-temperate lakes, are lacking. We used all
  available Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources point-intercept creel survey
  data during 1990–2020 to test for seasonal differences in the fisheries for five
  species targeted by open water and ice anglers in Wisconsin, USA, lakes (black crappie
  Pomoxis nigromaculatus, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, northern pike Esox lucius,
  walleye Sander vitreus, yellow perch Perca flavescens). Specifically, we tested
  for: 1) species-specific differences in mean open water versus ice angling catch
  and harvest rates; 2) trends in species-specific mean open water versus ice angling
  catch and harvest rates during 1990–2020; and 3) monthly patterns in mean species-specific
  angler effort and catch rates. Mean angler catch rates of the five study species
  were significantly higher during the open water season and mostly temporally stable
  – only black crappie and bluegill open water catch rates and black crappie ice season
  catch rates significantly increased during 1990–2020. Mean angler harvest rates
  were significantly higher in the open water season for black crappie, bluegill,
  and walleye. Harvest rates were significantly higher during the ice season for northern
  pike and did not differ between seasons for yellow perch. Harvest rates were mostly
  temporally stable across species, although harvest rates declined for bluegill ice
  fishing and yellow perch in both seasons. Species-specific angler effort and catch
  rates mostly corresponded with seasonal (spring/early summer) vulnerabilities of
  our study species, although higher winter effort and catch rate patterns for northern
  pike and yellow perch may suggest unique harvest preferences for those species.
  Our results suggest that ice angling should not be assumed to have a negligible
  influence on fish populations in north-temperate lakes, fisheries-dependent and
  -independent monitoring data should be jointly considered when assessing fish population
  status, research on the human dimensions of ice fisheries is critically needed,
  and angler knowledge of seasonal fish vulnerabilities are generally coupled with
  higher fish catch rates.'
