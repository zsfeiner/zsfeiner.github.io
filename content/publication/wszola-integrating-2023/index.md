abstract: Human behavior shapes modern ecosystems but is difficult to parse into parameters
  for ecological models. We used Bayesian models of human behavior, a stage-structured
  population model, and a novel mortality integration approach to ask how human decisions
  affect animal population dynamics and conservation outcomes in the context of recreational
  fishing. Walleye (Sander vitreus) are a broadcast-spawning freshwater fish with
  large, slow-maturing females and small, fast-maturing males. We observed that simpler
  and less restrictive fishing regulations outperformed more complex and stricter
  regulations at conserving equilibrium adult female abundance and overall population
  abundance while still facilitating large harvests. This outcome was possible because
  angler behavior within the least restrictive regulation concentrated harvest on
  juveniles and adult males. Our findings indicate that, counter to intuitive expectations,
  moderate regulations can acheive conservation objectives when we account for the
  interaction of regulatory policy, human behavior, and animal life history. We suggest
  that integrating models of human behavior with models of animal life history and
  population dynamics will provide essential insights for conservation in ecosystems
  increasingly shaped by human decisions.
