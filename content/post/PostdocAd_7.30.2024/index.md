The [Center for Limnology](https://limnology.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is seeking two postdocs to contribute to projects focused on quantitative modeling of Great Lakes and inland lake fish populations and fisheries. The postdocs will work with Drs. [Olaf Jensen](https://jensen.limnology.wisc.edu/), [Jake Vander Zanden](https://jvzlab.limnology.wisc.edu/), and [Zach Feiner](https://zsfeiner.github.io/), joining a team of aquatic ecologists and fisheries scientists at several other state, federal, and tribal institutions. Projects may include (1) social-ecological systems modeling of inland recreational fisheries as they respond to climate change effects on fish communities, (2) the development of stock assessment models that incorporate tagging data to explore environmental influences on population dynamics, and (3) analysis of data sources including walleye temperature tags, creel surveys, and population monitoring to identify characteristics of climate change "bright spots" (i.e., populations that are unexpectedly robust to climate change impacts). Other possibilities include development of foraging and bioenergetic models, and analysis of Great Lake and inland lake creel survey data.  Positions are funded for 2 years.

*Qualifications*: 
Required 
-	A PhD in biology, ecology, fisheries science, math, statistics or a related field.
-	Strong coding skills in R
-	Ability to work independently and as part of a team

Desirable (applicants without these qualifications are still encouraged to apply)
-	Experience developing and testing stock assessment models 
-	Experience developing agent-based or other simulation models
-	Familiarity with TMB/ADMB/JAGS 
-	Experience with electronic tag and creel data, and foraging and bioenergetic models 
-	Strong record of publication in peer-reviewed journals

UW-Madison is committed to providing opportunities to people from all backgrounds to help create a welcoming, empowered, and inclusive community. UW-Madison encourages women, minorities, veterans, and people with disabilities to apply.

*Support*:
Salary $58,500 per year and a competitive benefits package. 

*Application Instructions and Timeline*: 
For priority consideration applicants should submit by August 15, 2024 a single pdf that includes, (1) a one page cover letter outlining: your research experiences and interests, potential start date, and relevant skills as they pertain to these opportunities; (2) your curriculum vitae; and (3) contact information for 3 references to Kelly O'Ferrell ([oferrell@wisc.edu](mailto:oferrell@wisc.edu)).
