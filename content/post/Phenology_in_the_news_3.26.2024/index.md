Our [new paper](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10383) in Limnology and Oceanography Letters has generated some news coverage.

In our newly published article led by Martha Barta, find that the phenology of ice-off and walleye spawning, historically tightly-linked phenological events, are becoming decoupled with climate change.  While both are shifting earlier and becoming increasingly unpredictable over time, ice-off is shifting about 3.5 times faster than walleye, suggesting walleye are unable to keep up with the pace of climate change.  In addition,  extreme phenological years (either early or late) were strongly negatively linked with walleye recruitment, meaning climate-driven instability in phenology can have direct consequences for the persistence of this important species.
