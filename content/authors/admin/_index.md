Zach Feiner (he/his) is a fisheries research scientist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Limnology. His research focuses on inland freshwater ecosystems, including the impacts of climate change on freshwater fish and fisheries, angler behavior and the effects of fishing on ecological and evolutionary processes in fish populations, and the importance of changing phenology to the functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

In addition to his research, Zach co-chairs the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts [(WICCI)](https://wicci.wisc.edu/fisheries-working-group/) Fisheries Working Group, tasked with identifying and developing adaptation strategies for climate risks to Wisconsin fisheries. He also serves on the [Midwest Glacial Lakes Partnership](https://midwestglaciallakes.org/) Science and Data Team, contributing to a regional network of scientists to better understand the relative importance of habitat, climate change, and other environmental factors on fish communities.
